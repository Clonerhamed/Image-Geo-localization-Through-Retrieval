# Image-Geo-localization-Through-Retrieval
Visual Place Recognition (VPR), also known as Visual Geo-localization (VG), identifies the geographic location of images. This study used ResNet-18 on the GSV-XS dataset and tested on SF-XS and Tokyo-XS datasets. The GeM pooling layer was later added, and different loss functions and data augmentations were used to improve recall@N metrics.
